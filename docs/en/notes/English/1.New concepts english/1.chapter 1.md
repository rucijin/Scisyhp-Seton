### Slient enemies
Few countires will admit officially that they employ spies. However, from time to time, a spy is caught and the pubilc sometimes gets a glimpse of what is going on behind the political scenes. Spies are rarely shot these days. They are frequently tried and imprisoned. If a spy is important enough, he is sometimes handed back to an enemy country in exchange for an eaually spy whom the enemy have caught. Few people have the opportunity to witness such exchanges, for they are carried out in secret.

On cold winter morning on December 17th last year, a small blue car stopped on a bridge in a provincial town in northern Germany. Three men dressed in heavy black coats got out and stood on the bridge. While they waited there, they kept on looking over the side. Fifteen minutes later, a motor boat sailed past and drew up by the river bank. Three men got out of the boat and looked up at the bridge. The men on the bridge silently walked down the stone steps leading to the river bank. No words were spoken when they met the men from the boat. After a while, The motorboat moved off and three men returned to the bridge. Now only two of them were wearing black coats. The third was dressed in a light grey jacket. Anyone who had been watching the scene might not have realized that two master spies had been exchanged on that cold winter morning.
